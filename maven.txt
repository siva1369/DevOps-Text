maven
--------------
maven is a product of apache.

maven is build tool.it package the source code and build the artifact (war,jar,exe,msi).


API vulnerabilitys


maven global server (search.maven.org)

here avilble API's which are free from vulnerabilitys


all the open source communities like jenkins,tomcat,mysql etc upload their updated API's into maven global server

developers connect to the maven global server ,download those API's that are necessary for the project development and they store them into maven local repository.

all developers connect to maven local repository amd perform the ddevelopment activity 

in this way the code is stored seperately in github. the api's requires for the code development are stored in maven local repository

this will helps in protecting the source code from any threats/viruses that might be present in the API'S

maven is also a build tool. where it can compile the programs and create a atrifact .



we need to install java jdk file from oracle 

where the jdk is installed path

c:\program files\java\jdk1.8.0_271

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_333

copy this path

this pc --> properties --> advanced system setting --> advanced tab --> environment variables --> system variable --> new


variable name = JAVA_HOME
variable value = c:\program files\java\jdk1.8.0_271,,C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_333,


ok

path -- C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_333\bin


download apache maven


create new enviroment variable



variable name = M2_HOME

variable value = E:\apache-maven-3.8.6-bin\apache-maven-3.8.6

new path = E:\apache-maven-3.8.6-bin\apache-maven-3.8.6\bin


for checking maven configure or not

open CMD

mvn --version



artifact:-
 
it is a final file of source code



maven number :-

mvn archetype:generate (in CMD)


type of project is dependent on the above number 

1740 -- for spring project 
1797 -- for sample maven project 
1244 -- mvc 4 web application
2630 -- project for multiple platforms web , android and ios



let's select the defolt number= 1797 enter defolt number



group id :-

this is for project structure

ex :-

for commercial application -- ex: com.<project_name>

for government application -- ex: gov.<project_name>

for organization application -- ex: org.<project_name>



define the value for group id =com.hdfc

what is artifactid : webapphdfc (with this name artifact will be created)

we get build success massage with project location

in project folder we got two files 

1. src

main -- the total code 
test --  unit test

2. pom.xml

pom - project object modal

in this will store the API's information


here open git bash and commit the directories

how to download the API's 

in the browser select our required api take dependency tag copy it

than open the pom.xml file in that file we can observe the dependency tag select that one and past it and save 

than download the API's

in cmd

> cd webapphdfc
> mvn compile

maven local repository is created with the name .m2  (this is hidden folder)

observe the project file

we have get third folder that is "target"

open git bash and commit these target folder and modified pom.xml


now we need to compile all java files 

in cmd 

> mvn compile

this will compile the files in the test file 

> mvn test

than pakage a source code of class file and genarate an artifact

> mvn package
